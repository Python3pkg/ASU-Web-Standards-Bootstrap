# ASU Bootstrap Addon

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gios-asu/ASU-Bootstrap-Addon.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gios-asu/ASU-Bootstrap-Addon)

This ASU Bootstrap Addon provides stylesheets to be consistent with the new ASU Web Standards that are being rolled out to the schools at ASU.  The theme is based off of the work done by 29thDrive and is consistent with their initial work.

This theme uses Font Awesome.  Bootstrap natively provides Glyphicons, which means both can be used in tandiem.

This theme uses the Google Font Roboto.  If you do not include Roboto in your website using the instructions provided on [Google Font's website](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto), font will default to 'Helvetica Neue', then Helvetica, and then Arial.

For more information concerning all of the new components and CSS styles that are introduced in this theme, check out [https://gios-asu.github.io/](https://gios-asu.github.io/).
