- Secondary Sidebar nav fix
  - If the content is not big enough to hold the nav, it causes a lot of problems.
- Hero image text should have a transparent black box behind it with padding
- Panel title overflows off the page when too small
- Nav menu super menus dont work on mobile
- Linked images have a dotted line through them
